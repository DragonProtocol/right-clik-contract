## Contract Deployment


deploy to eth rinkeby:
```bash
  forge create --rpc-url https://rinkeby.infura.io/v3/${YOUR_API_CODE} \
    --constructor-args "synthetic NFT" "SNFT" \
    --private-key ${YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY} \
    src/SyntheticNFT.sol:SyntheticNFT
  
```
deploy to BSC testnet:
```bash
  forge create --rpc-url  https://data-seed-prebsc-1-s1.binance.org:8545 \
    --constructor-args "synthetic NFT" "SNFT" \
    --private-key ${YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY} \
    src/SyntheticNFT.sol:SyntheticNFT
  
```

## Usage/Examples


```javascript

  uint newTokenId = _syntheticNFT.mint{value: _price}(to, contractAddr, tokenId);

  _syntheticNFT.refund(newTokenId);

```

you can get more help from test case code.
## Running Tests

```bash
  forge test
```

 - When mint, you can inject some ether as asset of NFT.
 
 - When refund/burn NFT, ether asset will be withdrawn.

   
## Bonding Curve:

 The core concept of a bonding curve is quite simple: The price of a token is determined by its supply. The more tokens that have been distributed, the higher the price

 - New NFT can be minted (bought) at any time according to a price set by the contract.
 - This price increases as token supply grows.
 - The ether paid for tokens is kept in the contract (reserve pool).
 - At any point in time, NFT can be burned (sold) back to the contract.

we take a simple curve formula: y = mx^2, with a base of 0.001 ether.


```javascript

  function calcMintPrice() public view returns (uint256) {
    return BASE_PRICE + BOND_CURVE_M * totalSupply() * totalSupply();
  }   

```
